# Prior Projects

I only have one completed paper at the moment and it is not yet publicly available

It was a paper titled "Effects Of Interannual Trends On Seawater Carbonate Chemistry Across The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary"

It was mainly studying how from 2015 - 2018 (and one year of data in 2007) the chemistry specifically carbonate chemistry varied within that time period. This was done to get a more comprehensive view of the FGB's variability in carbonate chemistry for the corals and possible explanation as to why the corals bleached so suddenly in the summer of 2016.

I will update and leave a link to the paper as soon as I can

## Current Projects

I am currently developing a thesis on oxygen variability related to hypoxic tolerance on coral reefs in Guayanilla Bay, Puerto Rico.
