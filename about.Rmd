I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, but moved to Dallas, Texas when I was four years old. I did K-12 and earned my bachelors degree in Texas. I love to travel and meet new people so feel free to contact me for any questions you may have for me.

## Conclusion

Combating climate change is a vital issue that affects people of any race, socio-economic status, religion, creed, gender or no gender, age, nationality, or any other label because this is a global problem. It us to all of us (as a species) to take accountability for our actions against the planet and other species inhabiting this Earth for the future of humanity to enjoy a healthy and plentiful Earth.
