# Education

Attended Texas A&M University from 2018 to 2022 and obtained a degree in Oceanography from the College of Geoscience (which no longer exists). I am currently attending graduate school at University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez in the department of Marine Science for a masters thesis degree in chemical oceanography.

## Conclusion

Combating climate change is a vital issue that affects people of any race, socio-economic status, religion, creed, gender or no gender, age, nationality, or any other label because this is a global problem. It us to all of us (as a species) to take accountability for our actions against the planet and other species inhabiting this Earth for the future of humanity to enjoy a healthy and plentiful Earth.
